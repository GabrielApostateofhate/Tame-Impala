    <p id="description">"Lonerism" — другий студійний альбом австралійського музичного проєкту Tame Impala, випущений 5 жовтня 2012 року на лейблі Modular Recordings. Як і дебютний альбом гурту, Innerspeaker (2010), Lonerism був написаний, записаний, виконаний і спродюсований Кевіном Паркером, причому учасник живого складу Джей Вотсон долучився до двох треків. Записаний переважно в Перті (Австралія) та Парижі (Франція), альбом розвиває психоделічне звучання свого попередника, з меншою кількістю гітар і більшою кількістю синтезаторів і семплів. Паркер намагався втілити свою любов до поп-музики через більш мелодійні та запам’ятовувані мотиви. У багатьох треках звучать навколишні звуки, записані Паркером на диктофон. Тема ізоляції, яка пронизує альбом, відображена на обкладинці, де зображений сад Люксембург у Парижі, відгороджений парканом.

                Are you too terrified to try your best?
                Just to end up with an educated guess
                Like success
                All those times you wake up mystified
                Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
                Never held something so close I couldn't keep
                Into the day the strangest feeling

                On and on we all go
                Into another morning
                Doesn't even matter?
                (It could be the day that all our dreams come true)
                It was only yesterday
                
                Didn't even know you
                Now I'm gonna miss you

                Should my cover ever blow
                Would you ever let it go?
                There is something you should know
                But hell if I'd ever let it show
                
                So here I am, trying to be strong
                It was noon, now my shadow's long
                I guess I'll go and tell you just as soon as I 
                Get to the end of this song
                To the end of this song, to the end of this song
                To the end of this song, to the end of this song
                
                The curse has won again
                Soon I'll be alone
                Take all you can
                But please understand
                It never really was love
                
                All I give are little clues
                Maybe one day I'll get through
                But there is nothing you can do
                I'll just keep on lying to you</p>

                To get shy when they ask him who is on top
                There must be something deep down in the dark down there
                He's not too easily scared
                
                He's got friends but they got the fear
                Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
                Oh, look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs
                (Here he comes)
                
                He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (yeah)
                'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
                He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
                
                Somebody grabbed his collar
                He cried the whole way home
                No one remembered a thing when they saw him again
                That's how it is 'til the end

            <p class="text">Bet he feels like an elephant
                Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
                You know that you dreaming about being loved by him
                Too bad your chances are slim
                
                And it's not like Mr. Shock
                To get shy when I ask him if he's on top
                There must be something deep down in the middle of down there
                He's not too easily scared
                
                He's got friends but you get the feeling
                Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
                Oh, look there he is now coming down the stairs
                (Here he comes)
                
                He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (yeah)
                'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
                He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
                Somebody grabbed his collar
                He cried the whole way home
                He won't remember a thing 'til it started again
                That's how it is 'til the end (yeah)</p>
