                But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
                "Let it happen, let it happen" (it's gonna feel so good)
                "Just let it happen, let it happen"
                
                All this running around
                Tryin' to cover my shadow
                A notion growing inside
                Now all the others seem shallow
                
                All this running around
                Bearing down on my shoulders
                I can hear an alarm
                Must be a morning
                
                I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
                It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
                And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
                So let it happen, let it happen
                
                All this running around
                I can't fight it much longer
                Something's tryin' to get out
                And it's never been closer
                
                If my take-off fails
                Make up some other story
                If I never come back
                Tell my mother I'm sorry
                
                I cannot vanish, you will not scare me
                Try to get through it, try to push through it
                You were not thinking that I will not do it
                They be lovin' someone and I'm another story
                Take the next ticket, get the next train
                Why would I do it? Anyone'd think that

                I felt the strangest emotion, but it wasn't hate
                For once
                Yes, I'm changing, yes, I'm gone
                Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on

                They do
                Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now

                And I can't always hide away
                Curse indulgence and despise the fame
                There is a world out there and it's calling my name
                And it's calling yours

            <p class="text">I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
                Which was standard for me
                Thursday, 12:30, I gotta pretty solid routine these days
                I don't know it just works for me
                Anyway, I was leaving I was getting in my car
                And I went to adjust the rear view mirror, but in its reflection
                Just for a second, I saw a figure, started to trigger
                Memories of what I had learned, stopped me in my tracks
                Who was that? It was my lover, my lover, from a past life
                
                From a past life (feel like I saw a ghost)
                From a past life (not what I expected)
                From a past life (it's transfixed)
                From a past life
                
                Well somewhere between a lover and a friend
                It was different back then, surreal
                Poetic so I'd say, like a bizarre shape or a confusing image
                But I shot it down, closed it off
                The sounds and smells I made myself forget
                A cheap solution to block out a friend, but it was real
                It just feels like a past life
                
                From a past life (crazy)
                From a past life (it takes a lot to trip me out)
                From a past life
                In the long time
                
                So I go about my day as normal
                But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
                It consumes me, I thought I was moving on
                But I guess I was just switching off
                And now I see my life as the banal slog it suddenly became
                And I don't know if I can go on the same
                But I don't wanna dig up old bones
                I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
                Who knows? Maybe she does
                
                From a past life
                (I guess there's no harm in trying)
                From a past life
                From a past life
                In the long time
                From a past life
                From a past life
                From a past life
                In the long time

                Now it's like the world owes you
                Walking around like everybody should know you
                I wanna be like we used to

                And I had no idea

                I used to take the long way
                Just so I could walk past your door
                I used to wait outside

                It dawns on me, what have I done?
                Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
                But it buys me a little more time
                
                Lost in the moment for the second time
                Each fuck up that I make that makes you cry

                Once again, as it takes a hold
                I am aware I'm not in control
                You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
                But it's prone to be overruled
                
                You wanna know why I always think I'm right?
                (Why?)
                Can never accept defeat and let it slide
                (Why?)
                I have no voice if I don't speak my mind
                (Why?)
                My weakness is the source of all my pride
                I'll tell you why

                The worst in me, and I know now
                Do you remember the time we were
                The time we were by the ocean?
                I didn't care if it was day or night

                Now I gotta tell 'em I don't care and hope that nobody might work it out
                It was obviously an illusion 'cause there's never been so much I've been wrong about
                And I don't want to spend all my days thinking of the one I can't live without

                'Til it becomes another one of the things that I just can't talk about
                I'm gonna have to keep you on my list of people to try and forget about

                Ooh, I was hoping it would come out right
                Who was I kidding?
                
                Push the button and start counting down
                Ooh, time is crawling to the moment
                Beyond which
                
                I can choose
                I can fall
                I can lose control
                I concur
                With the doubt
                But I can't
                Turn back 'round
                And they dread
                What's beyond
                But time
                Is rolling on
                Rolling on
                
                Now let's do this right
                Everybody (and I'll be trying)
                It won't come out right
                
                I can fold
                I can lose control
                I can lose control
                I can face the unknown (ooh)
                Yes, I must
                Venture there
                If I fail (ooh)
                I don't care
                
                (Now let's do this right)
                There's so much
                Left unclear
                But it's time
