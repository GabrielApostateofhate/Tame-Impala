                She doesn't like the life that I lead
                Doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
                Or sitting around smoking weed
                I must seem more like a friend in need
                
                And I boast that it is meant to be

                I don't have a hope in hell
                I'm happy just to watch her move

                And she doesn't like the friends that I make
                Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
                She just gets bored sitting by the lake
                Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache
                
                And I boast that it is meant to be

                But, in all honesty
                He didn't have a hope in hell

                While they may, depending on your words and wealth
                The only one who's really judging you is yourself
                Nobody else
                Nobody else
                
                If I could part
                It wouldn't be so hard
                Well, it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
                That you are
                All you're meant to be
                When the one from my dream
                Is sitting right next to me
                And I don't know what to do
                Oh, alter ego</p>

                There's everywhere I'd rather go
                It's true that some things have to change
                Oh no

                I'm the one who's left behind
