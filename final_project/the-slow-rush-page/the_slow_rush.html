            <p class="text">Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
                Our minds were racing and time went slow
                If there was trouble in the world we didn't know
                If we had a care, it didn't show
                But now I worry our horizon's bear nothing new
                'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it, too
                We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
                'Cause what we did one day on a whim
                Has slowly become all we do
                
                I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
                I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
                And now I fear we might
                Oh, now I fear we might
                
                But it's okay, I think there's a way
                Why don't we just say one more year?
                (One more year)
                Not worrying if I get the right amount of sleep
                (One more year)
                Not caring if we do the same thing every week
                (One more year)
                Of living like I'm only living for me
                (One more year)
                Of never talking about where we're gonna be
                (One more year)
                One more year
                Of living like the free spirit I wanna be
                
                We got a whole year
                (One more year) Fifty-two weeks
                Seven days each
                (One more year) Four seasons, one reason
                One way, one year
                (One more year)
                One year, one year
                From today (From today)
                From today (From today)
                
                I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
                Now one of these is gonna be the last for all time
                
                For all time
                
                One more year</p>

            <p class="text">Ever since I was a small boy
                No one else compared to you, no way
                I always thought heroes stayed close
                Whenever troubled times arose
                I didn't know, ain't always how it goes
                
                Every single word you told me
                I believed without a question, always
                To save all of us
                You told us both to trust
                But now I know you only saved yourself
                
                Did you think I'd never know?
                Never wise-up as I grow?
                
                And you could store an ocean in the
                holes in any of the explanations that you gave
                And while you still had time, you had a chance
                but you decided to take all your sorry's to the grave
                
                Did you think I'd never know?
                Never wise-up as I grow?
                Did you hope I'd never doubt?
                Never one day work it out?
                
                You were runnin' for cover
                Doin' like any other
                Fallen out with a lover
                You didn't know that I suffered
                What a thing to discover
                
                If there was time to recover
                One on one with each other
                Just a boy and a father
                What I'd give for another
                
                Everything that I have
                I wouldn't need us for long

                Wanna tell you about the time
                I was in Abbey Road
                Or the time that I had
                Mick Jagger on the phone
                I thought of you when he spoke

                You're just a man after all
                And I know you had demons
                I got some of my own
                I think you passed them along
                
                I wanna tell you about the time
                Wanna tell you about my life

                Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
                
                Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
                Eventually terrible memories turn into great ones
                
                So if they call you, embrace them
                If they hold you, erase them
                
                Cause it might've been something, who's to say?
                Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
                And you might have missed something, don't say
                Cause it hurts to be lost in yesterday
                And you're gonna have to let it go someday
                You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
                Cause it might've been something, don't say

                Said "oh what I'd give to start over, Boy I'd command it"
                So what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?
                
                Why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry

                If they stall you, erase them

                Cause it hurts to stay lost in yesterday
                
                If it calls you, embrace it
                If it haunts you, face it
                I know it's mad, I understand
                It's all just snakes and ladders
                The myriad, you never had
                There's only one that matters
                If it calls you, embrace it
                If it holds you, erase it</p>

                From the past to the happenin'
                We started talkin' 'bout devotion
                The kind that goes on eternally
                And I tell her I'm in love with her

                I was happy just listening
                No intention to be mentioning

                'Cause she's the only thing I think of
                I told my mother that I love her
                
                She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
                It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
                Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care

                (Move on) how can I walk this path for sure?
                (Lose her) with no more time to spend
                (Move on) I know the answer more and more
                
                As long as I can
                Long as I can
                Spend some time alone
                As long as I can
                Long as I can
                Be the man I am
                
                Oh, life is strange
                For one more hour
                I can rage
                For one more hour
                
                As long as I can (lose her)
                As long as I can (move on)
                Spend some time alone
                As long as I can (lose her)
                As long as I can (move on)
                Remember who I am

        "Після прослухування цього альбому буде відчуття піднесення. Настільки "радісного звуку" від Tame Impal`и я давно не чув. Альбом віддає літнім вайбом, піщані береги далекого моря, але не забуває, що по жанру він психоделіка. One more hour/year нагадує про це" </i> - @Я. Найпопулярніша пісня з The Slow Rush - Borderline. В промо-роликах до "Slow Rush Tour" був представлений психоделічний препарат "Rushium", якого насправді не існеує.

                Spend late nights, tryna impress the wicked
                Off two tabs, I'm gone
                Mind too fried, couldn't remember the digits
                
                She want a glass of Prosecco
                The bitch that she with trippin', leave her at the Petco
                I'm still the same kid from the metro
                She ride out of drugs, had to ball call petrol
                
                Lookin' in her eyes, see the meadow
                Lookin' at her lips, pillow kiss, it's the wet throat
                She say she never been to the ghetto
                Put her on the tab, turn the hood to a disco
                
                Now she rockin', and I'm rockin', and we feelin' it out
                All that energy I held in, I'm givin' it out
                I forgot 'bout my problems, I'm livin' it up
                I can not feel my feet, I been dancin'
                I been grindin' my teeth while she rantin'
                Everybody shut the fuck up and start dancin'
                
                Grindin' my teeth while she rantin'
                Look in my eyes, I can't touch, it's the madness
                
                Seems you're comin' on
                Breathe a little deeper
                Should you need to come undone
                And let those colors run?
                Now you're havin' fun
                So do this and get through this
                And come find me when you're done
                So we can be as one
                
                Dim lights, tonights, wanna go again
                Loose legs, all on my back, can't feel the wind
                I see stars every time I hold your hand
                You can leave your car, self-drive in a brand-new Benz
                
                Loosen up your guard
                Hope this shit last, I don't want it to end
                Hope you do your part
                I just need you to snap in both in of your hands
                
                Mmm, like that
                I love the way you move when it like that
                Heard you paid all of your dues with a rain check
                You turned me to a fool for insane sex
                
                You passed the love test
                Join the mile-high club on the plane next
                Heart beatin' like, "Can't go"
                I can't wait to shut the fuck up and dance though

                Remember those lies you told your friend?
                I was hopin' you could do it once more again
                That rooftop party won't seem to end
                I need you here, alone with me
                
                My love and my high, don't break my heart
                You're all I got, you all I need
                Don't leave me cold outside to rot
                But I'm so depressed, I feel bulimic
                
                My soul restored, I want a call
                Fuelin' your heart to me, I mean it
                DMT which is inside my brain
                I had dinner with God, just thank God I seen Him
                
                Heaven's too real, the dream won't fill
                Trust me, with my own eyes, baby girl, I seen it
                Late-night vibes, I need your high
                Let me get one hit, baby girl, I'm fiendin'
                
                In too deep to cut my ties
                I'm way too hot, I just left Venus
                Try my best to make you smile
                Never said that I was perfect, I still fight demons
                
                IPhone pics, I saw that story
                Look drunk as fuck, I think you need me
                Rubbin' your body just like it's gold
                Your dress is the bottle and you the genie
                
                OMG, let's spice things up
                I got a little bit of ecstasy in my feelings
                Lovin' on you is takin' its toll
                I hope you still gonna love me and that you mean it

            <p class="text">We were hangin' in the morning
                Feelin' all different kinds of things
                We were talkin' about everything
                From the past to the happenin'
                We started talkin' 'bout devotion
                The kind that goes on eternally
                And I tell her I'm in love with her
                But how can I know that I'll always be
                
                She just said, is it true, is it true, tell me now
                It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
                Was I in some kind of mood, I don't know, I don't care
                Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
                She's in my
                
                I was happy just listening
                No intention to be mentioning
                We started talkin' 'bout the future
                'Bout the notion I was motioning
                I'm just so terrified to face her
                Like any moment I might wake up
                'Cause she's the only thing I think of
                I told my mother that I love her
                
                She just said, is it true, is it true, tell me now
                It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
                Was I being immature, I don't know, I don't care
                Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
                She's in my
                In my
                
                I said, we'll see, we'll see (in my)
                We'll see
                Ah, we'll see (in my)
                We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
                See how it goes
                Until we know what the future holds
                
                Ah, we'll see
                We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
                See how it goes</p>

                Gone a little far
                Gone a little far this time for something
                How was I to know
                How was I to know this high came crushing?
                We're on the borderline

                Possibly a sign
                I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
                
                Go, there I go
                Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
                Askin' how I managed to end up in this place

                Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
                Then I saw the time (then I saw the time)
                Watched it speedin' by like a train, like a train
                
                Will I be known and loved, is there one that I trust?
                Starting to sober up, has it been long enough?
                Will I be known and loved, little closer, close enough
                I'm a loser, loosen up, setting free must be tough
                Will I be known and loved, is there one that I trust?
                In this room, room for doubt, as with you as without ya
                Will I be so in love, any closer close enough

                Gone a little far this time with something
                How could I have known
                How was I to know this high came crushing?
                I said, "Come with me outside

                Do you see the light coming from their eyes?

                Gets me every time, these close encounters

                Once again, I am alone

                And it isn't gonna dry, conversation, well, I tried (I was fine without ya)
